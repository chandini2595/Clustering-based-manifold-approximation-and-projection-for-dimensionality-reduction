# Clustering-based manifold approximation and projection for dimensionality reduction 

This repository contains materials related to the exploration of CBMAP (Clustering-Based Manifold Approximation and Projection), a dimensionality reduction algorithm that balances the preservation of global and local structures in data. 

CBMAP addresses key limitations of existing methods (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) and is designed to provide efficient, scalable, and robust dimensionality reduction. This repository includes:
